```python
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import HomePage from './HomePage';
import ProductPage from './ProductPage';
import PCBuilder from './PCBuilder';
import VRShowroom from './VRShowroom';
import './styles.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div className="App">
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/" exact component={HomePage} />
          <Route path="/product/:id" component={ProductPage} />
          <Route path="/pc-builder" component={PCBuilder} />
          <Route path="/vr-showroom" component={VRShowroom} />
        </Switch>
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

```

This is the main entry point of the frontend application. It uses React Router to handle navigation between different pages of the application. The `HomePage`, `ProductPage`, `PCBuilder`, and `VRShowroom` components are placeholders for the actual components that would be developed for each of these pages. The application is rendered into the 'root' DOM element.

Please note that the actual implementation of the `HomePage`, `ProductPage`, `PCBuilder`, and `VRShowroom` components, as well as the CSS styles, are not included in this code snippet. They would need to be developed separately, following the UI/UX design specifications and using the shared dependencies as required.
